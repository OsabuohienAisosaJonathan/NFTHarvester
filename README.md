The requirements to run this project includes:
    *A code editor (preferrably Visual studio code)
    *Ethereum wallet
    *metamask account 
    *A feasible NFT website / Opensea account

NFTHarvester is a technique used to steal Ethereum via authentication with the attacker's wallet. it monitors the NFT website content and listens for signs of an ethereum account, scans for balance. if any Ethereum account balance falls above supposed minimum limit, It will clear the attacked wallet of its contents and sends it to the attacker's wallet.
it repeats its attack indefinitely once there are received ethereum from an internal/external source.
